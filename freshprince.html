	<h1>The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air</h1>

		<p>
			<font size="6">	
				From western Philadelphia I hail
				where in my youth I'd play upon the green
				'til - rue the day! -I found myself assail'd
				by ruffians contemptible and mean.
				Although the spat was trivial and brief,
				it wounded my dear mother deep within;
				and so, to give her conscience sweet relief,
				she sent me forth to live amongst her kin.
				When to my port of call I'd been conveyed,
				I came upon a coachman most unique;
				and yet, I simply took the trip and paid,
				despite his cab's decor and fresh mystique.
				I survey all the land with princely mien
				in fair Bel-Air, where I do lay my scene.
